# Employee-Summary-Generator
Here is a Team list generator useable for any project. This will help you orginize all employees that you have in a readable and orginized fashion. When you run the program, it will ask you to enter the information for all of your employees. Once you have entered all the data you need, it will generate an HTML page that lists out all team members.

Here is a link for a video to show it in action:  https://youtu.be/iI3HFb_wPAI
